## üéØ `Objective`  

The objective of this project is to build a serverless automation pipeline that monitors EBS volumes, identifies gp2 volumes, and converts them to gp3 with full logging, alerting, and audit trail.

This ensures:
`1.` Cost Optimization
`2.` Performance Improvement
`3.` Operational Efficiency
`4.` Security & Compliance
`5.` Disaster Recovery (via snapshots/rollback)
