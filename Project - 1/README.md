# Enable Cross-Region Backup Replication for EC2 using AWS Backup

## üìå Objective
The objective of this project is to configure an AWS Backup Plan that automatically backs up an EC2 instance in the primary region and replicates those backups to a secondary AWS region.  
This ensures **data durability, high availability, and disaster recovery readiness** across geographically separated regions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps

### 1. Select Regions and Launch EC2 Instance
- **Primary Region:** Europe (Frankfurt ‚Äì eu-central-1)  
- **Secondary Region:** Canada (Central ‚Äì ca-central-1)  
- Launched an EC2 instance in Frankfurt using Amazon Linux (t2.micro).  
- Configured Security Group to allow **HTTP (Port 80)** and **SSH (Port 22)**.  
- Connected to the instance via SSH.

### 2. Install and Configure Nginx with Test Application
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install nginx -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx
Created a simple HTML test page in /usr/share/nginx/html/test.html.


3. Create Backup Vaults
Created PrimaryEC2Vault in Frankfurt.

Created SecondaryEC2VaultCanada in Canada.





4. Create Backup Plan
Used AWS Backup template Daily-35day-Retention.

Configured rule:

Backup Vault: PrimaryEC2Vault

Frequency: Daily

Lifecycle: Warm ‚Üí Cold storage

Added Copy Rule: Copy to Canada (ca-central-1) ‚Üí SecondaryEC2VaultCanada








5. Assign Resources
Assigned EC2 instance (i-0545b6e883c95a7c5) to backup plan.

IAM Role used: AWSBackupDefaultServiceRole




6. Run On-Demand Backup
Triggered manual backup from Frankfurt.

Backup stored in PrimaryEC2Vault.






7. Verify Cross-Region Copy
Verified Copy Jobs in Frankfurt.

Status: Completed ‚Üí Confirmed replication to Canada.



8. Test Restore in Canada
Opened SecondaryEC2VaultCanada.

Verified recovery points created.

Launched EC2 from replicated AMI in Canada.

Verified same test application output.







‚úÖ Result
Cross-Region Backup Replication for EC2 using AWS Backup was successfully implemented.
Backups from Frankfurt were automatically copied to Canada, and the instance was restored from the replicated backup in Canada.

üåü Benefits of Cross-Region Backup Replication
Disaster Recovery (DR): Protects workloads if primary region fails.

Data Durability: Ensures backups are safe across regions.

Compliance & Governance: Supports regulatory requirements.

High Availability: Enables faster recovery in secondary region.

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered and Resolutions
Cross-Region Copy Delay

Recovery points did not appear immediately because only new backups are copied.

Resolved by creating on-demand backups in Frankfurt.

Restore Failure via AWS Backup Console

Restore failed due to missing VPC/subnet/security groups in Canada.

Resolved by launching EC2 directly from AMI in Canada and selecting correct networking.
